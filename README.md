# Fish And Plants

# INTRODUCTION
One of the most dangerous problem on earth is the amount of GHGs present in the air. 
Agricultural practices causes the 21% of the entire GHGs produced and causes the rising of temperature on earth (and more).
In this scenario, is obvious to see that our farming system is not efficient. 
Of course, we may limitate the meat consumption, or drive electric vehicles, but humanity (and not only) needs to feed, 
and our missions is reach the carbon neutrality in the entire food production with the least use of water and chemical substances. (2030 goals)

For many years, researchers have been trying to study different agricultural practices to reduce the GHGs.
A lot of solutions are good candidate to try to fix this problem. Our choices are the aeroponic greenhouse farming and the aquaponics greenhouse farming, 
because of their limit consumption of water and chemical products.

Step 1 - Aeroponic greenhouse
This code, collect data from Raspberry Pi temperature and moisture sensors and evaluate when is the perfect time to irrigate, in order to reduce the water waste. It also evaluate the life conditions of plants and change the percentage of N, P and K in order to be efficient.



This is a WIP project, more information soon!

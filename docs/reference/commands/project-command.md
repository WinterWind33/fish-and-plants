# `project` command

The `project` command is responsible to manage the lifetime and configuration of a Greenhouse. It can be used to create, save and load projects configurations for your `rpi_gc` application.

**NOTE: THIS DOCUMENTATION IS WIP AND THE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL.**

## Structure of a project

In this section, we'll see how the project is structured and represented.

### Basic project data

The basic data of a project is a set of these values:

- `version` : this represents the version of the `rpi_gc` application that last loaded the project. The version is automatically upgraded if a newer version of `rpi_gc` is launched with the project that was generated from an older version;
- `creation time` : this represents the time and date of the creation of the project. This field will be useful for statistical analysis;
- `title` : the name of the project;

## Command usage

### `--create` option

This will create a new project with the specified title. The creation time and versioning is automatically generated by the software.

After the project is generated the old project (if any loaded) is closed and the newly created one will be switched to.

#### Example

In this example, it will be create a new project entitled `example`:

```bash
project --create example
```

### `--load` option

This command will load a project from the specified file.

The project is loaded and parsed. The application has a `title` and `version` integrity checker that can automatically update the project title or version if they contain invalid or old data.

If the JSON syntax is broken **it will result in undefined behavior**: the project can be loaded, discarded or partially loaded. Be careful.

#### AWS Running

If the AWS is running while performing a `project --load` operation, the AWS is stopped, its configuration saved to the current project (if open) and the new project is loaded:

- if the new project is valid, it will be loaded and the AWS restarted with the new configuration;
- if the new project is invalid, the AWS will restart with the old configuration.

#### Example

The following command will load the project contained inside the file `my-project.json`:

```bash
project --load my-project.json
```
